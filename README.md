This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a Data Warehouse solution integrated with Data Analytics workflows. It covers the full pipeline from data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) to querying, reporting, and visualization.

The goal is to provide a centralized repository of historical data that supports business intelligence (BI), reporting, and data-driven decision-making for Data Analysts.
